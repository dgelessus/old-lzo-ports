What is LZO ?
=============

LZO is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C.
It offers pretty fast compression and *very* fast decompression.
Decompression requires no memory.

In addition there are slower compression levels achieving a quite
competitive compression ratio while still decompressing at
this very high speed.


What is Perl ?
==============

Perl is an interpreted programming language optimized for scanning
text and useful for many system management tasks. To find out more,
point your browser to http://www.perl.org/ .


What is Perl-LZO ?
==================

Perl-LZO provides LZO bindings for Perl5. I.e. you can access the
LZO library from your Perl scripts thereby compressing ordinary
Perl strings.


Any caveats ?
=============

As I'm no Perl guru I'm not sure if I got everything right - it
works fine for me, though.

Bug fixes and other feedback are welcome.
