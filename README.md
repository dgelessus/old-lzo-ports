# Old LZO Ports

This is an unofficial copy of the original `java-lzo`, `perl-lzo` and `python-lzo` libraries by Markus F. X. J. Oberhumer, released under the GNU General Public License version 2 (see the `COPYING` files in the individual directories). These ports of the LZO library to Java, Perl and Python were originally released in the years 1998-1999 and are provided here mostly for historical purposes, as they are no longer available on [the LZO page](http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/) on http://www.oberhumer.com/.

`java-lzo` 1.00 was written for JDK 1.0 and 1.1, but it still appears to work under Java 8. A newer, unrelated implementation of LZO in Java, written by Karmasphere/Shevek and others, can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/Karmasphere/lzo-java).

An official updated version of `perl-lzo`/`Compress::LZO` can be found [on CPAN](https://metacpan.org/pod/Compress::LZO).

`python-lzo` 1.00 was written for Python 1.5. An updated version, by Joshua D. Boyd and others, can be found [on PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-lzo) with source code [on GitHub](https://github.com/jd-boyd/python-lzo).
